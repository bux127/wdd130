            <p class="first">The annual Umhlanga Reed Dance marks the biggest cultural gathering of the Swazi people. Coming after an eight-day ceremony, unmarried girls gather in a centipede-like structure and dance with reeds. The festival begins in late August or early
                September and aims to strengthen bonds of community amongst a new generation of homemakers. A captain, locally known as ‘induna’ is appointed by the royal family to announce and organize the ceremony. The use of the reed as the official
                mascot is a nod to the historical relevance of the plant to the lives of the Swazi people.

                The cultural village is a living museum of old traditions and represents a classical Swazi lifestyle during the 1850's. The building material is strictly traditional: poles, grass, reeds, leather stripes, earth and dried cow dung. The Mantenga Cultural
                Village is a mini complex of sixteen huts, each with its own specific purpose, kraals and byres for cattle and goats, reed fences that serve as windbreaks, and various other structures. With the traditional artifacts on display, the village
                illustrates many facets of the ancient Swazi way of life: social, economic and religious. The objective of the cultural village is to enable visitors from all over the world as well as Swazis from all corners of the country to visit it
                and to maintain a positive interest in the Swazi cultural heritage, including language, customs and practices, rituals, dance, music, folklore, arts and crafts.
