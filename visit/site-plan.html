        <p>Besides from having beautiful scenery it is also known as the Mother of Conservation, the Kingdom has very old nature reserves. The name ‘Mlilwane’ (‘Little Fire’ in siSwati) was derived from the numerous fires started by lightning strikes on
            the Mlilwane Hill but now holds significance as the little fire that ignited the conservation movement in eSwatini. The activities on-site and in the surroundings include nature trails, horse riding, mountain biking, and game drives. Guests
            can explore the craft shops in Ezulwini and Malkerns.

        <h3>Culture</h3>
        <p>The annual Umhlanga Reed Dance marks the biggest cultural gathering of the Swazi people. Coming after an eight-day ceremony, unmarried girls gather in a centipede-like structure and dance with reeds. The festival begins in late August or early
            September and aims to strengthen bonds of community amongst a new generation of homemakers. A captain, locally known as ‘induna’ is appointed by the royal family to announce and organize the ceremony. The use of the reed as the official mascot
            is a nod to the historical relevance of the plant to the lives of the Swazi people.

        <p>
            The cultural village is a living museum of old traditions and represents a classical Swazi lifestyle during the 1850's. The building material is strictly traditional: poles, grass, reeds, leather stripes, earth and dried cow dung. The Mantenga Cultural
            Village is a mini complex of sixteen huts, each with its own specific purpose, kraals and byres for cattle and goats, reed fences that serve as windbreaks, and various other structures. With the traditional artifacts on display, the village
            illustrates many facets of the ancient Swazi way of life: social, economic and religious. The objective of the cultural village is to enable visitors from all over the world as well as Swazis from all corners of the country to visit it and
            to maintain a positive interest in the Swazi cultural heritage, including language, customs and practices, rituals, dance, music, folklore, arts and crafts.

        <p>
            Sibebe Rock, just north of Mbabane, is one of southern Africa’s most impressive geological features. This immense three-billion-year-old volcanic slab, which rises to a height of 1,488m and covers some 16,500ha, is the world’s largest granite dome. Only
            Australia’s Uluru pips it to the title of ‘world’s largest rock’. Uluru is actually an eroded sandstone inselberg – in other words, formed of layers of sediment. Sibebe, by contrast, is a batholith: it welled up through the earth’s crust in
            one great molten bubble before cooling to form a massif of sheer granite. More of a proper rock, I like to think. It is hard to appreciate the scale of Sibebe from below. That’s partly because there is no single spot from which the whole rock
            is visible; and partly, also, because large areas of it are vegetated, with patches of grassy hillside and forested clefts – like toupees on a balding pate – that break up the bare rock into what appear to be discontinuous outcrops. The best
            way to see it is, of course, to climb it.

        <p>Watch our glassblowers creating wonderful african animal figurines and tableware using 100% recycled glass, from an overhead balcony. Feel the heat of the furnace and understand why we say we are the HOTTEST attraction in Swaziland. Our well stock
            showroom is attached to the factory and there is a coffee shop offering light meals. Beer and wine also available. In our well established gardens there is an array of well stocked craft shops selling Swazi Fair Trade products, all produced
            within Swaziland. Central in the garden is a jungle gym for the young ones to enjoy whilst the adults shop.</p>
