    <p>Hey there my fellow classmates, my name is Innocent Makhanya all the way from Sourthen Africa, Swaziland. i am currently taking a degree on Applied Technology. I am a good fan of comedy so i love watching such and also reading together with research
        are part of the things that excites me. i have a lot of love and respect for BYU Idaho since it comes highly recommended and its part of those schools that have mad ea name for themselves and as of now i am currently taking a wdd course. I have
        a high interest in this course since the world is under digital migration so i can see a huge job potential in it and i also wish to own my own softaware design company someday.</p>
